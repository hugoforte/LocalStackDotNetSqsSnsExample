# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a .NET solution that integrates with LocalStack (a local AWS cloud stack) to test Amazon SQS functionality. The solution will include a test project that can spin up a LocalStack Docker container, create SQS queues, and verify their creation using the AmazonSQSClient. This enables local development and testing of AWS SQS functionality without requiring actual AWS resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a .NET solution structure that supports LocalStack integration testing, so that I can test AWS SQS functionality locally without incurring AWS costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the solution is created THEN it SHALL contain a main project and a test project
2. WHEN the solution is built THEN it SHALL compile successfully with all necessary dependencies
3. WHEN the project structure is examined THEN it SHALL follow .NET solution conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want LocalStack Docker container management in my tests, so that I can have an isolated AWS environment for each test run.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL automatically start a LocalStack Docker container
2. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up the LocalStack Docker container
3. WHEN the LocalStack container is running THEN it SHALL expose SQS services on the expected port
4. IF Docker is not available THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create SQS queues programmatically using AmazonSQSClient, so that I can test queue creation functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test creates a queue THEN it SHALL use the AmazonSQSClient configured for LocalStack
2. WHEN a queue is created THEN the system SHALL return a valid queue URL
3. WHEN the AmazonSQSClient is configured THEN it SHALL point to the LocalStack endpoint
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN it SHALL use dummy credentials for LocalStack

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that created queues exist in LocalStack, so that I can confirm the queue creation was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a queue is created THEN the test SHALL verify the queue exists by listing queues
2. WHEN listing queues THEN the created queue SHALL appear in the results
3. WHEN queue verification fails THEN the test SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN multiple queues are created THEN each SHALL be independently verifiable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test isolation and cleanup, so that tests don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN each test SHALL have an isolated LocalStack environment
2. WHEN a test completes THEN it SHALL clean up any created resources
3. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
4. WHEN cleanup fails THEN it SHALL not cause subsequent tests to fail
